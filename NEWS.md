# unheadr 0.1.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Added a `.slice_groups` argument to `unbreak_vals` to either keep or discard the variable with broken values and slice the extra rows afterwards. 

* Reworded all the documentation with more adecuate terms (i.e. embedded subheaders).
