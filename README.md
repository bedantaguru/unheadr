unheadr
=======

The goal of unheadr is to help wrangle data (often other people's) when it has too many header rows, or when values are wrapped across several rows.

Installation
------------

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("luisDVA/unheadr")
```

At this point, refer to the links in the vignette for more information and examples.
